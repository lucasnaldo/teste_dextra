This is a test to check your skills in Problem Solving, Basic Mathematical knowledge as well as Python programing language

# Problem to Solve.

You have the opportunity to make a investment buying some financial assets with discount.
You will pay for those assets R$ 300.000,00 ( Three hundred thousand reais) in the day D.
This invest contain a lot of assets and you want to know what is the internal rate of the investiment.

Besides calcutate the internal rate of investiment you want to compare wheter this investment is better than a Selic rate.

# You have to:
Understand the CSV file and how its is relateded with the concepts of internal rate of investiment in irregular cash flow;

# Proposed exercise
Create an Python application that performance the following tasks:

- Read an CSV file with the assets;

- Calculate the IRR(You must create your own algorithm (don't use any python mathematical function for that) we want to test your logical thinking here

- Consume a public web service that return the Selic rate of the day;

- Show the IRR calculated and the Selic rate in console;

- Store the information of the CSV file, the calculated IRR and Selic rate in a in memory database - Feel free to use structure or framework you like.

- Create a Docker image with the application ready to use;

# Unit tests
- Create unit tests with 50% code coverage
